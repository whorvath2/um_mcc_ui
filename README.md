# Summary

This is the front end of an application for calculating the cost of meetings that include University of Michigan staff.

## Description

This is a [react](https://reactjs.org)-based UI that uses the [um_mcc](https://github.com/whorvath2/um_mcc) API to calculate the cost of a meeting that includes University of Michigan staff. It leverages their [published salaries](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ti4iff026agzpak/salary-disclosure-2022.pdf?dl=0) to enable the search and selection of meeting attendees. By choosing meeting attendees and entering its length, the user can see the actual cost of the meeting in terms of how much the university is spending to have the attendees there.


## Inspiration

Meeting invitations are often sent without an agenda, which makes their business value very difficult to determine. Knowing what they will cost brings a new level of accountability to the organizer.

## Dependencies

This application requires access to a running instance of the um_mcc API.
